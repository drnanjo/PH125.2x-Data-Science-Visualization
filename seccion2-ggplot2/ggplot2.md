### Section 2 Overview

In Section 2, you will learn how to create data visualizations in R using **ggplot2**.

After completing Section 2, you will:

* be able to use ggplot2 to create data visualizations in R.
* be able to explain what the data component of a graph is.
* be able to identify the geometry component of a graph and know when to use which type of geometry.
* be able to explain what the aesthetic mapping component of a graph is.
* be able to understand the scale component of a graph and select an appropriate scale component to use.

There are 2 assignments that use the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

Note that it can be hard to memorize all of the functions and arguments used by ggplot2, so we recommend 
that you have a [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) 
handy to help you remember the necessary commands.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.
