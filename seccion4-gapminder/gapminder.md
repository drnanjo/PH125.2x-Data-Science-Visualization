### Section 4 Overview

In Section 4, you will look at a case study involving data from the Gapminder Foundation about trends in world health and economics. 

After completing Section 4, you will:

* be able to apply the ggplot2 techniques from the previous section to answer questions using data.
* understand how fixed scales across plots can ease comparisons.

There are 2 assignments that use the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.
