### Section 5 Overview

Section 5 covers some general principles that can serve as guides for effective data visualization.

After completing Section 5, you will:

* understand basic principles of effective data visualization.
* understand the importance of keeping your goal in mind when deciding on a visualization approach.
* understand principles for encoding data, including position, aligned lengths, angles, area, brightness, and color hue.
* know when to include the number zero in visualizations.
* be able to use techniques to ease comparisons, such as using common axes, putting visual cues to be compared adjacent to one another, and using color effectively.

There are 3 assignments that use the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.

#### Section 5: Data Visualization Principles   5.1 Data Visualization Principles, Part 1   Introduction to Data Visualization Principles

We have already provided some rules
to follow as we created plots for our examples.
Here we aim to provide some general principles
we can use as guidelines for effective data visualization.
Much of this part of the course is based on a talk
by **Karl Broman** entitled 

    "Creating Effective Figures and Tables"

and from class notes from **Peter Aldhous** titled

    "Introduction to Data Visualization."

In many of our examples, we follow Karl's approach.
We show some examples of plot styles we should
avoid, explain how to improve them, and then use these
as motivation for a list of principles.
We compare and contrast plots that follow these principles to those that
don't.
The principles are mostly based on research
related to how humans detect patterns and make visual comparisons.
The preferred approaches are those that best
fit the way our brain processes visual information.
When deciding on a visualization approach
it is also important to keep our goal in mind.
We may be comparing a viewable number of quantities,
describing distributions for categories or numeric values,
comparing the data from two groups, or describing
the relationship between two variables.
As a final note, we also know that for a data scientist
it is important to adapt and optimize graphs to the audience.
For example, an exploratory plot made for ourselves
will be different than a chart intended to communicate
a finding to a general audience.
